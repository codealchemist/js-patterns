js-patterns
===========

Here you'll find examples of JavaScript patterns.
More or less just the code with basic documentation, but not extensive explanations.

This is a great online console you can use to test the patterns:
- [repl.it](http://repl.it/languages/JavaScript)

Readings:

And, of course, a must read book:
